1. Analyze the frontend routes, components, and navigation
2. Map API endpoints and controllers
3. Review data models and service logic
4. Create `high_level_features.md` in the repository root

The document should include:

- Detailed subfeatures under each area
- Microservices architecture table
- Data storage documentation
- Feature summary matrix (implemented vs not implemented)
