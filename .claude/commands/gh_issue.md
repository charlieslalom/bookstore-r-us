Create a new GitHub issue in the active repository.

Ask the user for:
1. **Title**: What should be the issue title?
2. **Description**: What is the detailed description of the issue?

Then create the issue with the label `issue_ingestion` using the GitHub CLI.

If the `issue_ingestion` label doesn't exist, create it first with a green color.

Return the URL of the created issue.
