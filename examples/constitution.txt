ARCHITECTURAL CONSTITUTION
Guiding Principles for System Design
=====================================

SECURITY PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: The system must never store passwords in plaintext
PRINCIPLE: All sensitive data shall be encrypted both at rest and in transit
PRINCIPLE: Authentication tokens must have expiration times
PRINCIPLE: The system shall not log credit card numbers or CVV codes
RULE: Security vulnerabilities must be patched within 48 hours of discovery
- The system must not use deprecated cryptographic algorithms
- All user input shall be validated and sanitized
- Session management must be secure and prevent session fixation

PERFORMANCE PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing
PRINCIPLE: The system shall implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
RULE: No single API endpoint may have response time exceeding 5 seconds
- Network calls should be asynchronous where possible
- The system must scale horizontally to handle increased load

DATA INTEGRITY PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: All database transactions must be ACID compliant
PRINCIPLE: The system shall never lose customer data
RULE: Data modifications must be auditable with complete history
- Referential integrity must be maintained at all times
- Critical data operations shall be performed within database transactions

CODE QUALITY PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: All code must follow established coding standards
PRINCIPLE: Code coverage for unit tests shall be at least 80%
RULE: No code may be deployed to production without peer review
- Functions should not exceed 50 lines of code
- Dependencies must be kept up to date

USER EXPERIENCE PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: The system must provide clear feedback for all user actions
PRINCIPLE: Error messages shall be user-friendly and actionable
RULE: The UI must not use pop-up advertisements
- Loading states should be indicated to users
- The system should work on mobile devices

OPERATIONS PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: The system must support zero-downtime deployments
PRINCIPLE: All configuration shall be externalized from code
RULE: The system must not require manual intervention for routine operations
- Logging must be structured and searchable
- The system should auto-recover from transient failures

COMPLIANCE PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: The system must comply with GDPR requirements
PRINCIPLE: PCI DSS compliance shall be maintained for payment processing
RULE: User consent must be obtained before collecting personal data
- Data retention policies must be enforced automatically
- Users must have the ability to delete their accounts and data

RELIABILITY PRINCIPLES

PRINCIPLE: The system must maintain 99.9% uptime
PRINCIPLE: Critical services shall have redundancy and failover
RULE: Single points of failure must not exist in production
- Health checks must be implemented for all services
- Circuit breakers should prevent cascade failures
